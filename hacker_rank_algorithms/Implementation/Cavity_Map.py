'''
You are given a square map of size nÃ—n.
Each cell of the map has a value denoting its depth.
We will call a cell of the map a cavity if and only if
this cell is not on the border of the map and each cell
adjacent to it has strictly smaller depth.
Two cells are adjacent if they have a common side (edge).

You need to find all the cavities on the map
 and depict them with the uppercase character X.
